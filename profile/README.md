## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the OpenProphetDB! OpenProphetDB is an open research group focused on unlocking the potential of existing drugs to save patients with rare and complex diseases. We explore the following topics: constructing and integrating knowledge graph, multi-omics data, and deep learning models to understand the molecular mechanisms of human rare and complex diseases, or to predict new indications for known drugs through drug repurposing.  Visit our [official website](https://prophetdb.org) for more information.

## Useful Resources

### Network Medicine Platform

#### Online Web System

If you are interested in using knowledge graph and deep learning models to understand the molecular mechanisms of human rare and complex diseases, or to predict new indications for known drugs through drug repurposing. please visit our [Network Medicine Platform](https://drugs.3steps.cn/) to get started or the [biomedgps](https://github.com/open-prophetdb/biomedgps) repository to install the platform locally.
